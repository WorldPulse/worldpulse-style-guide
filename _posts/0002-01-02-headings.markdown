HTML pages form an outline of content (like paragraphs and images) into a
hierarchical structure. Heading tags are used to create divisions in this
outline. Administrators have access to use some heading tags within their
content.

## Automatically generated titles (page and site level headers)

{% include sample.html sample=h1 %}
{% include sample.html sample=h2 %}

These heading levels, `<h1>` and `<h2>`, are automatically generated by the
system for page and site titles. They are not available in the visual editor
for editorial content.

## Subtitles and section headers for use in content

{% include sample.html sample=h3 %}
{% include sample.html sample=h4 %}
{% include sample.html sample=h5 %}
{% include sample.html sample=h6 %}

These heading levels, `<h3>` through `<h6>`, can be used in editorial content to
help establish the hierarchy of an article.
