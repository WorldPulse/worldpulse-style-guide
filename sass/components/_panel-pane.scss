 * Styles for panel panes
 */

// Some general styles which apply only to some panes. To be selective, we'll
// extend this below.
%panel-pane-content {
  padding: 1em;
  margin-bottom: 1em;
  border: 1px solid wp-color($grey, highlight, -5%);
}

// "Primary content" stuff (main node content, etc). Generally, we'll extend
// this onto .panel-pane elements in content areas, rather than individually.
// See below.
%panel-pane-primary {
  @extend %panel-pane-content;
  border: 1px solid wp-color($grey, highlight, -5%);
  border-bottom-width: 2px;
  @include border-radius(3px);
  background-color: wp-color($grey, highlight, 5%);
}

// "Secondary content" stuff (sidebars, etc.). Generally, we'll extend this
// onto .panel-pane elements in sidebar or auxiliary regions, rather than
// individually. See below.
%panel-pane-secondary {
  @extend %panel-pane-content;
  border: 1px solid wp-color($grey, highlight, -3.5%);
  border-bottom-width: 2px;
  background-color: wp-color($grey, highlight, 2.5%);
}

// When a pane is inside a region wherein it has inherited one of the
// %panel-pane-[primary|secondary] extensions (below), but it is a special
// case which should not have the padding or border, we clear that off here.
// Note that a strong selector may be required.
%panel-pane-override-clear {
  padding: 0;
  border: none;
  background-color: transparent;
}

// General Panels setup. Apply panel-pane-primary directly to .panel-pane if the
// pane title should be included in the visible container (in the case of a
// user-generated title like nodes, user profiles, etc...). Apply to the direct
// child .pane-content when the title should appear above the box (in the case
// of a system/site generated title like "Resources" or "Add content" etc...)
.panel-pane {
  &.pane-node,
  &.pane-user-profile,
  &.pane-page-content > .pane-content {
    @extend %panel-pane-primary;
  }

  h1, .pane-title {
    margin-top: 0;
  }
}

.pane-element {
  margin-top: 1em;
}

// Many pages, especially system pages like /user, /user/%/edit, /note/%/edit
// etc... follow this format of [.main-container > title + the-stuff]. In which
// case. gracefully wrap the-stuff.
#first-time, // #first-time is the Drupal home page placeholder until we put something there
.main-container h1 + article,
.main-container h1 + form,
.main-container > h1 + dl, // The content and descriptions on /node/add is just a definition list of node types
.main-container h1 + .view {
  @extend %panel-pane-primary;
}

// These "secondary" content items (primarily sidebar or meta stuff) get a
// similar treatment as most panel-panes, but with a slightly more subtle
// background color and border color.
.l-two-column .column-2 {

  // Right now, most of these sidebar panes are Views, and we apply this extention
  // to .view-content instead (see _views.scss) so that the view is wrapped but
  // the title isn't. This rule extends non-View panes as a whole, but this
  // may not be visually consistent. @TODO: May need to rethink this once we
  // have views and non-view panes working. Also this isn't IE8 supported.
  .panel-pane:not(.pane-views-panes) .pane-content { @extend %panel-pane-secondary; }
}
